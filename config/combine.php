| Cloud Storage Folders.
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Sometimes you might have a folder you want to upload to cloud storage.
| As part of our automated process we want to be able to upload these 
| folders for you. An example would be an images folder. Your combined
| CSS is good to put in cloud storage but uploading the images that 
| make up your website is even better. 
|
| Below is an array of folder paths. This system will loop through the 
| different files in these folders and make sure they are uploaded
| to your cloud storage. So in the case of Racksapce we would create a 
| "folder" at rackspace named the same thing. http://cdnurl.com/foldername/file1.jpg.
|
| We do not delete files on rackspace but we will update or add. The reason we do not 
| delete is this is the web. If you upload one file someone could link to it. If you
| delete it you just broke thier link. If you update or add a file to the folders
| the file will make its way to your cloud storage provider.
